Apache Kafka introduced the exactly-once semantics in [0.11 release](https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/0.11.0.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html). Jay Kreeps, co-founder of Confluent, wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@jaykreps/exactly-once-support-in-apache-kafka-55e1fdd0a35f) about the exactly-once semantics works in Kafka, and triggered a fruitful discussion with a series of blog posts came from a number of distributed systems people. 

[In this StrangeLoop talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WscozkoXLHM), Jason Gustafson discusses the new exactly-once semantics of Apache Kafka.
