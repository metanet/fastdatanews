Tim Berglund introduces basic concepts of Apache Kafka Streams in a new video series. The content is split into 4 parts as follows:
- In the [first part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3JKCLG3VP4), Tim introduces the Kafka Streams API, and talks about how you can write and deploy stream processing tasks using the API. 
- In the [second part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxxeXI1mPKo), he creates a sample application and focuses on two particular concepts: KStream and KTable. 
- In the [third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JYEEx7SBuE) and [fourth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kJgYIkAeHs) parts, Tim elaborates processing tasks of the sample application using the data transformation and processing utilities in the Streams API. 


I always find Tim Berglundâ€™s videos very helpful and informative. He makes a good job on the Kafka Streams videos as well. For the interested readers, I highly recommend his [distributed systems videos](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039518.do).
