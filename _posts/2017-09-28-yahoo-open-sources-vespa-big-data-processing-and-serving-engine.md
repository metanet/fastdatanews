Today, Yahoo [open sourced](https://www.oath.com/press/open-sourcing-vespa-yahoo-s-big-data-processing-and-serving-eng/) their [Vespa](http://vespa.ai/) Big Data Processing and Serving Engine. 

Vespa simplifies building systems that serves to user requests by computing responses using large scale data sets at real-time.   Its main use case in Yahoo is the search and recommendation systems. However, Vespaâ€™s capabilities are not limited to this use case. Vespa feeds stored data and models to the serving system and runs the final computations upon user requests. It can run on-premise or in the cloud.
