Apache Pulsar is a distributed pub-sub messaging system, targeting horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and low latency. I consider it as a competitor of Apache Kafka. 

The 1.20.0-incubating release of Apache Pulsar has been [announced](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/releases/tag/v1.20.0-incubating) a couple of days ago. There are a number of new features to note, such as: 
- End to end encryption,
- Supporting event time, 
- Message deduplication.

I have been coming across posts and news about Apache Pulsar recently. I am planning to investigate Apache Pulsar and write a detailed post about it.
